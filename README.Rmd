###Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set 

####Data Set Information:
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

tidy dataset is the combination of train and test datasets with every mean feature.
it has `r nrow(tidy)` observations and `r ncol(tidy)` columns.
Active is a factor variable with the folling levels `r levels(tidy$activity)`.

##Variables in tidy data set ("tidy.csv", with ";" as separetor)
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE} 
str(tidy)
```

##Variable from Tidy.Summary dataset (tidy_summary.csv, with ";" as separetor)
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
str(tidy.summary)
```
